What If I Really Enjoyed This Book?

Please email me at adam@adam-freeman.com and let me know. It is always 
a delight to hear from a happy reader, and I appreciate the time it takes 
to send those emails. Writing these books can be difficult, and those
emails provide essential motivation to persist at an activity that can 
sometimes feel impossible.

What If This Book Has Made Me Angry and I Want to Complain?

You can still email me at adam@adam-freeman.com, and I will still try to help you. 
Bear in mind that I can only help if you explain what the problem is and what 
you would like me to do about it. You should understand that sometimes the only 
outcome is to accept I am not the writer for you and that we will have closure only
when you return this book and select another. I’ll give careful thought to whatever 
has upset you, but after 25 years of writing books, I have come to understand 
that not everyone enjoys reading the books I like to write.

Summary

In this chapter, I set the scene for the rest of the book. I provided 
a brief overview of ASP.NET Core, explained the requirements for and 
the content of this book, and explained how you can contact me. In the next
chapter, I show you how to prepare for ASP.NET Core development.
