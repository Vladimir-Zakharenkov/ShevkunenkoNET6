CHAPTER 1

Putting ASP.NET Core in Context

ASP.NET Core is Microsoft’s web development platform. The original ASP.NET was introduced 
in 2002, and it has been through several reinventions and reincarnations to become 
ASP.NET Core 6, which is the topic of this book.

ASP.NET Core consists of a platform for processing HTTP requests, a series of principal 
frameworks for creating applications, and secondary utility frameworks that provide 
supporting features, as illustrated by Figure 1-1.
