Click the Continue button, and the installer will download 
the installation files, as shown in Figure 2-2.

When the installer files have been downloaded, you will be presented 
with a set of installation options, grouped into workloads. Ensure that the 
“ASP.NET and web development” workload is checked, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Select the “Individual components” section at the top of the window and ensure 
the SQL Server Express 2019 LocalDB option is checked, as shown in Figure 2-4. 
This is the database component that I will be using to store data in later chapters.
