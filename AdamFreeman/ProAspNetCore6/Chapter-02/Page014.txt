Click the Install button, and the files required for the selected workload will 
be downloaded and installed. To complete the installation, a reboot may be required.

Installing the .NET SDK

The Visual Studio installer will install the .NET Software Development Kit (SDK), 
but it may not install the version required for the examples in this book. 
Go to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/
6.0 and download the installer for version 6.0.0 of the .NET SDK, which is 
the long-term support release at the time of writing. Run the installer; 
once the installation is complete, open a new PowerShell command prompt 
from the Windows Start menu and run the command shown in Listing 2-1, 
which displays a list of the installed .NET SDKs.

Listing 2-1. Listing the Installed SDKs

dotnet --list-sdks

Here is the output from a fresh installation on a Windows machine that has 
not been used for .NET:

6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

If you have been working with different versions of .NET, you may see 
a longer list, like this one:

3.1.101 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.401 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

Regardless of how many entries there are, you must ensure there is one for 
the 6.0.1xx version, where the last two digits may differ.
