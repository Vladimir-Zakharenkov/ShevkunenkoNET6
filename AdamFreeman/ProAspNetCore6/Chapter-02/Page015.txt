Installing Visual Studio Code

If you have chosen to use Visual Studio Code, download the installer 
from https://code.visualstudio.com. No specific version is required, 
and you should select the current stable build. Run the installer and
ensure you check the Add to PATH option, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Installing the .NET SDK

The Visual Studio Code installer does not include the .NET SDK, which 
must be installed separately. Go to
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0 and download 
the installer for version 6.0.0 of the .NET SDK, which is the long-term 
support release at the time of writing. Run the installer; once the
installation is complete, open a new PowerShell command prompt from 
the Windows Start menu and run the command shown in Listing 2-2, 
which displays a list of the installed .NET SDKs.

Here is the output from a fresh installation on a Windows machine that has not 
been used for .NET: 6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
