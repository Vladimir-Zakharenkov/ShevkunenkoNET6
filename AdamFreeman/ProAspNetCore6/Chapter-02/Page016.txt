If you have been working with different versions of .NET, you may see a longer list, 
like this one:

3.1.101 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.401 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

Regardless of how many entries there are, you must ensure there is one for the 6.0.1xx 
version, where the last two digits may differ.
