Listing 2-3. Creating a New Project

dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 6.0.403 --output FirstProject
dotnet new mvc --no-https --output FirstProject --framework net6.0
dotnet new sln -o FirstProject
dotnet sln FirstProject add FirstProject

The first command creates a folder named FirstProject and adds to it 
a file named global.json, which specifies the version of .NET that 
the project will use; this ensures you get the expected results when
following the examples. The second command creates a new ASP.NET Core project. 
The .NET SDK includes a range of templates for starting new projects, 
and the mvc template is one of the options available for ASP.NET Core applications. 
This project template creates a project that is configured for the MVC Framework,
which is one of the application types supported by ASP.NET Core. Don’t be intimidated 
by the idea of choosing a framework, and don’t worry if you have not heard of MVC—by 
the end of the book, you will understand the features that each offers and how they 
fit together. The remaining commands create a solution file, which allows multiple 
projects to be used together. 

Note
This is one of a small number of chapters in which I use a project template 
that contains placeholder content. I don’t like using predefined project templates 
because they encourage developers to treat important features, such as authentication, 
as black boxes. My goal in this book is to give you the knowledge to understand 
and manage every aspect of your ASP.NET Core applications, and that’s why 
I start with an empty ASP.NET Core project. This chapter is about getting 
started quickly, for which the mvc template is well-suited.
