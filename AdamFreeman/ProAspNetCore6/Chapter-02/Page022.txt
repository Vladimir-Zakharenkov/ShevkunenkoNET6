Figure 2-11. Opening the project in Visual Studio

Opening the Project with Visual Studio Code

Start Visual Studio Code and select File ➤ Open Folder. Navigate to the FirstProject 
folder and click the Select Folder button. Visual Studio Code will open the project 
and display its contents in the Explorer pane, as shown in Figure 2-12. (The default 
dark theme used in Visual Studio Code doesn’t show well on the page,
so I have changed to the light theme for the screenshots in this book.)
