Figure 2-12. Opening the project in Visual Studio Code

Additional configuration is required the first time you open a .NET project in 
Visual Studio Code. The first step is to click the Program.cs file in the Explorer pane. 
This will trigger a prompt from Visual Studio Code to install the features required 
for C# development, as shown in Figure 2-13. If you have not opened a C# project before, 
you will see a prompt that offers to install the required assets, also shown in Figure 2-13.
