Listing 2-7. Rendering a View in the HomeController.cs File in the Controllers Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace FirstProject.Controllers {

	public class HomeController : Controller {
		public ViewResult Index() {
			return View("MyView");
		}
	}
}

When I return a ViewResult object from an action method, I am instructing 
ASP.NET Core to render a view. I create the ViewResult by calling the View method, 
specifying the name of the view that I want to use, which is MyView.

Use Control+C to stop ASP.NET Core and then use the dotnet run command to compile 
and start it again. Use the browser to request http://localhost:5000, and you 
will see ASP.NET Core trying to find the view, as shown by the error message 
displayed in Figure 2-16.

Figure 2-16. Trying to find a view

This is a helpful error message. It explains that ASP.NET Core could not 
find the view I specified for the action method and explains where it looked. 
Views are stored in the Views folder, organized into subfolders.
Views that are associated with the Home controller, for example, are stored 
in a folder called Views/Home. Views that are not specific to a single controller 
are stored in a folder called Views/Shared. The template used to create 
the project added the Home and Shared folders automatically and added 
some placeholder views to get the project started.
