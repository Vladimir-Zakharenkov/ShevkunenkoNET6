If you are using Visual Studio, right-click the Views/Home folder in 
the Solution Explorer and select Add ➤ New Item from the pop-up menu. 
Visual Studio will present you with a list of templates for adding
items to the project. Locate the Razor View - Empty item, which can be 
found in the ASP.NET Core ➤ Web ➤ ASP.NET section, as shown in Figure 2-17. 
Set the name of the new file to MyView.cshtml and click the
Add button. Visual Studio will add a file named MyView.cshtml to 
the Views/Home folder and will open it for editing. Replace the contents 
of the file with those shown in Listing 2-8.

Figure 2-17. Selecting a Visual Studio item template

Visual Studio Code doesn’t provide item templates. Instead, right-click the 
Views/Home folder in the file explorer pane and select New File from the 
pop-up menu. Set the name of the file to MyView.cshtml and press Return. 
The file will be created and opened for editing. Add the content shown 
in Listing 2-8.

Tip
It is easy to end up creating the view file in the wrong folder. 
If you didn’t end up with a file called MyView.cshtml in the Views/Home 
folder, then either drag the file into the correct folder or delete 
the file and try again.
