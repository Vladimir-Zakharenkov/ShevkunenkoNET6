If you are new to .NET development, then start with Visual Studio. It provides 
more structured support for creating the different types of files used in ASP.NET 
Core development, which will help ensure you get the expected results 
from the code examples.

Note This book describes ASP.NET Core development for Windows. It is possible 
to develop and run ASP. NET Core applications on Linux and macOS, but most readers 
use Windows, and that is what I have chosen to focus on. Almost all the examples 
in this book rely on LocalDB, which is a Windows-only feature provided by
SQL Server that is not available on other platforms. If you want to follow 
this book on another platform, then you can contact me using the email 
address in Chapter 1, and I will try to help you get started.

Installing Visual Studio

ASP.NET Core 6 requires Visual Studio 2022. I use the free Visual Studio 2022 
Community Edition, which can be downloaded from www.visualstudio.com. 
Run the installer, and you will see the prompt shown in Figure 2-1.
