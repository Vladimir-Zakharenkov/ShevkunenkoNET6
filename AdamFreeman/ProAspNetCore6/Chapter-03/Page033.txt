CHAPTER 3

Your First ASP.NET Core Application

Now that you are set up for ASP.NET Core development, it is time to create 
a simple application. In this chapter, you’ll create a data-entry application 
using ASP.NET Core. My goal is to demonstrate ASP.NET Core in action, 
so I will pick up the pace a little and skip over some of the explanations 
as to how things work behind the scenes. But don’t worry; I’ll revisit these 
topics in-depth in later chapters.

Setting the Scene

Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Year’s Eve party and that 
she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically 
RSVP. She has asked for these four key features:

	A home page that shows information about the party

	A form that can be used to RSVP

	Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page

	A summary page that shows who is coming to the party

In this chapter, I create an ASP.NET Core project and use it to create a simple 
application that contains these features; once everything works, I’ll apply some 
styling to improve the appearance of the finished application.

Creating the Project

Open a PowerShell command prompt from the Windows Start menu, navigate to a convenient 
location, and run the commands in Listing 3-1 to create a project named PartyInvites.

Tip
You can download the example project for this chapter—and for all the other 
chapters in this book from https://github.com/apress/pro-asp.net-core-6.
