Listing 3-8. The Contents of the RsvpForm.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<title>RsvpForm</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div>
		This is the RsvpForm.cshtml View
	</div>
</body>
</html>

This content is just static HTML for the moment. Use the browser to request 
http://localhost:5000/home/rsvpform. The Razor view engine locates the RsvpForm.cshtml 
file and uses it to produce a response, as shown in Figure 3-2.

Linking Action Methods

I want to be able to create a link from the Index view so that guests can see 
the RsvpForm view without having to know the URL that targets a specific action 
method, as shown in Listing 3-9.
