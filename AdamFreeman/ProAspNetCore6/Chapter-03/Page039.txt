The addition to the listing is an a element that has an asp-action attribute. 
The attribute is an example of a tag helper attribute, which is an instruction 
for Razor that will be performed when the view is rendered. The asp-action attribute 
is an instruction to add an href attribute to the a element that contains a URL for
an action method. I explain how tag helpers work in Chapters 25–27, but this tag helper 
tells Razor to insert a URL for an action method defined by the same controller 
for which the current view is being rendered.

Use the browser to request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the link that 
the helper has created, as shown in Figure 3-3.

Figure 3-3. Linking between action methods

Roll the mouse over the RSVP Now link in the browser. You will see that the link 
points to the following URL:

http://localhost:5000/Home/RsvpForm

There is an important principle at work here, which is that you should use the features 
provided by ASP.NET Core to generate URLs, rather than hard-code them into your views. 
When the tag helper created the href attribute for the a element, it inspected 
the configuration of the application to figure out what the URL should be. This allows 
the configuration of the application to be changed to support different URL formats
without needing to update any views.

Building the Form

Now that I have created the view and can reach it from the Index view, I am going 
to build out the contents of the RsvpForm.cshtml file to turn it into an HTML form 
for editing GuestResponse objects, as shown in Listing 3-10.
