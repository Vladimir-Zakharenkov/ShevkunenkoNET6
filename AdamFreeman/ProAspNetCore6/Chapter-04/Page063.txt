Figure 4-1. Opening a project in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio

There are buttons at the top of the Visual Studio Solution Explorer that 
disable file nesting and show the hidden items in the project. When you open 
a project for the first time in Visual Studio Code, you may be
prompted to add assets for building and debugging the project. 
Click the Yes button.

Adding Code and Content to Projects

If you are using Visual Studio Code, then you add items to the project 
by right-clicking the folder that should contain the file and selecting 
New File from the pop-up menu (or selecting New Folder if you are adding a
folder).

Note
You are responsible for ensuring that the file extension matches the type 
of item you want to add; for example, an HTML file must be added with 
the .html extension. I give the complete file name and the name
of the containing folder for every item added to a project throughout 
this book, so you will always know exactly what files you need to add.
