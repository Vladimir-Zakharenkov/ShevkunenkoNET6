This command installs version 6.0.0 of the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 
package. The package repository for .NET projects is nuget.org, where you can search 
for the package and see the versions available. The package installed in Listing 4-11, 
for example, is described at 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer/6.0.0.

You can see the packages installed in a project by running the command shown 
in Listing 4-12.

Tip
The project file — which is the file with the .csproj extension — is used to keep 
track of the packages added to a project. You can examine this file by opening 
it for editing in Visual Studio Code or by right-clicking the project item in 
the Visual Studio Solution Explorer and selecting Edit Project File from 
the pop-up menu.

Listing 4-12. Listing the Packages in a Project

Managing Tool Packages

Tool packages install commands that can be used from the command line to perform 
operations on .NET projects. One common example is the Entity Framework Core tools 
package that installs commands that are used to manage databases in ASP.NET Core 
projects. Tool packages are managed using the dotnet tool command. To install 
the Entity Framework Core tools package, run the commands shown in Listing 4-14.

Listing 4-14. Installing a Tool Package

dotnet tool uninstall --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
