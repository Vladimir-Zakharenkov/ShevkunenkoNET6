Listing 4-18. Installing the Bootstrap CSS Framework

libman install bootstrap@5.1.3 -d wwwroot/lib/bootstrap

The command installs version 5.1.3 of the Bootstrap package, which is known 
by the name bootstrap on the CDNJS repository. The -d argument specifies 
the location into which the package is installed. The convention in ASP.NET Core 
projects is to install client-side packages into the wwwroot/lib folder.

Once the package has been installed, add the classes shown in Listing 4-19 
to the elements in the demo.html file. This is how the features provided 
by the Bootstrap package are applied.

Note
I don’t get into the details of using the Bootstrap CSS framework in this book. 
See https://getbootstrap.com for the Bootstrap documentation.

Start ASP.NET Core and request http://localhost:5000/demo.html, and you will see the styled
content shown in Figure 4-6.
