Debugging Projects

Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code both provide debuggers that can be used 
to control and inspect the execution of an ASP.NET Core application. Open 
the Program.cs file in the MyProject folder, and click this
statement in the code editor:

...
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
...

Select Debug ➤ Toggle Breakpoint in Visual Studio or select Run ➤ Toggle Breakpoint 
in Visual Studio Code. A breakpoint is shown as a red dot alongside the code statement, 
as shown in Figure 4-7, and will interrupt execution and pass control to the user.

Figure 4-7. Setting a breakpoint

Start the project by selecting Debug ➤ Start Debugging in Visual Studio or selecting 
Run ➤ Start Debugging in Visual Studio Code. (Choose .NET if Visual Studio Code 
prompts you to select an environment and then select the Start Debugging menu item again.)

The application will be started and continue normally until the statement to which 
the breakpoint is reached, at which point execution is halted. Execution can be 
controlled using the Debug or Run menu or the controls that Visual Studio and 
Visual Studio Code display. Both debuggers are packed with features — more so 
if you have a paid-for version of Visual Studio — and I don’t describe them 
in depth in this book. The Visual Studio debugger is described at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger,
and the Visual Studio Code debugger is described at
