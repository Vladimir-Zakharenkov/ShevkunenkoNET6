Creating the Application Project Folders

The next step is to create folders that will contain the application’s components. 
Right-click the SportsStore item in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer or 
Visual Studio Code Explorer pane and select Add ➤ New Folder or New Folder to create 
the set of folders described in Table 7-1.

Table 7-1. The Application Project Folders

Name				Description

Models				This folder will contain the data model and the classes that 
					provide access to the data in the application’s database.

Controllers			This folder will contain the controller classes that handle HTTP 
					requests.

Views				This folder will contain all the Razor files, grouped into 
					separate subfolders.

Views/Home			This folder will contain Razor files that are specific to the Home 
					controller, which I create in the “Creating the Controller and View” 
					section.

Views/Shared		This folder will contain Razor files that are common to all controllers.

Preparing the Application Services and the Request Pipeline

The Program.cs file is used to configure the ASP.NET Core application. Apply the changes shown in
Listing 7-5 to the Program.cs file in the SportsStore project to configure the basic application features.

Note
The Program.cs file is an important ASP.NET Core feature. I describe it in detail in Part 2.

Listing 7-5. Configuring the Application in the Program.cs File in the SportsStore Folder

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

//app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.UseStaticFiles();
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

app.Run();
