Starting the Data Model

Almost all projects have a data model of some sort. Since this is an e-commerce 
application, the most obvious model I need is for a product. Add a class file named 
Product.cs to the Models folder and use it to define the class shown in Listing 7-11.

Listing 7-11. The Contents of the Product.cs File
in the SportsStore/Models Folder

using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

namespace SportsStore.Models {

	public class Product {
		public long? ProductID { get; set; }

		public string Name { get; set; } = String.Empty;

		public string Description { get; set; } = String.Empty;

		[Column(TypeName = "decimal(8, 2)")]
		public decimal Price { get; set; }

		public string Category { get; set; } = String.Empty;
	}
}

The Price property has been decorated with the Column attribute to specify 
the SQL data type that will be used to store values for this property. 
Not all C# types map neatly onto SQL types, and this attribute
ensures the database uses an appropriate type for the application data.

Checking and Running the Application

Before going any further, it is a good idea to make sure the application builds 
and runs as expected. Run the command shown in Listing 7-12 in the SportsStore folder.

Listing 7-12. Running the Example Application
