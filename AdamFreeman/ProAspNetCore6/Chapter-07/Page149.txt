dotnet tool uninstall --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0

Defining the Connection String

Configuration settings, such as database connection strings, are stored in 
JSON configuration files. To describe the connection to the database that 
will be used for the SportsStore data, add the entries shown in
Listing 7-15 to the appsettings.json file in the SportsStore folder.

The project also contains an appsettings.Development.json file that contains 
configuration settings that are used only in development. This file is displayed 
as nested within the appsettings.json file by Solution Explorer but is always visible 
in Visual Studio Code. I use only the appsettings.json file for the development 
of the SportsStore project, but I explain the relationship between the files and how 
they are both used in detail in Chapter 15.

Tip
Connection strings must be expressed as a single unbroken line, which is fine in the code 
editor but doesn’t fit on the printed page and is the cause of the awkward formatting 
in Listing 7-15. When you define the connection string in your own project, make sure 
that the value of the SportsStoreConnection item is on a single line.

Listing 7-15. Adding a Configuration Setting in the appsettings.json File 
in the SportsStore Folder

{
	"Logging": {
		"LogLevel": {
			"Default": "Information",
			"Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
		}
	},
	"AllowedHosts": "*",
	"ConnectionStrings": {
		"SportsStoreConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=SportsStore;
		MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
	}
}

This configuration string specifies a LocalDB database called SportsStore and enables 
the multiple active result set (MARS) feature, which is required for some of the database 
queries that will be made by the SportsStore application using Entity Framework Core.

Pay close attention when you add the configuration setting. JSON data must be expressed 
exactly as shown in the listing, which means you must ensure you correctly quote 
the property names and values. You can download the configuration file from the GitHub 
repository if you have difficulty.

Tip
Each database server requires its own connection string format. A helpful site for formulating
connection strings is https://www.connectionstrings.com.
