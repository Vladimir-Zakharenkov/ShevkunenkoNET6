The static EnsurePopulated method receives an IApplicationBuilder argument, which is the
interface used in the Program.cs file to register middleware components to handle HTTP requests.
IApplicationBuilder also provides access to the application’s services, including 
the Entity Framework Core database context service.

The EnsurePopulated method obtains a StoreDbContext object through the IApplicationBuilder
interface and calls the Database.Migrate method if there are any pending migrations, 
which means that the database will be created and prepared so that it can store Product 
objects. Next, the number of Product objects in the database is checked. If there are 
no objects in the database, then the database is populated using a collection 
of Product objects using the AddRange method and then written to the database using the
SaveChanges method.

The final change is to seed the database when the application starts, which I have 
done by adding a call to the EnsurePopulated method from the Program.cs file, 
as shown in Listing 7-23.

Listing 7-23. Seeding the Database in the Program.cs File in the SportsStore Folder

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using SportsStore.Models;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.AddDbContext<StoreDbContext>(opts => {
	opts.UseSqlServer(
		builder.Configuration["ConnectionStrings:SportsStoreConnection"]);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped<IStoreRepository, EFStoreRepository>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

SeedData.EnsurePopulated(app);

app.Run();
