It is a little awkward to get the data returned from the action method. The result is 
a ViewResult object, and I have to cast the value of its ViewData.Model property 
to the expected data type. I explain the different result types that can be returned 
by action methods and how to work with them in Part 2.

Updating the View

The Index action method in Listing 7-24 passes the collection of Product objects from 
the repository to the View method, which means these objects will be the view model 
that Razor uses when it generates HTML content from the view. Make the changes 
to the view shown in Listing 7-25 to generate content using the Product view model objects.

Listing 7-25. Using the Product Data in the Index.cshtml File 
in the SportsStore/Views/Home Folder

@model IQueryable<Product>

@foreach (var p in Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>()) {
	<div>
		<h3>@p.Name</h3>
		@p.Description
		<h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
	</div>
}
