This tag helper populates a div element with a elements that correspond to pages of products. 
I am not going to go into detail about tag helpers now; it is enough to know that they are 
one of the most useful ways that you can introduce C# logic into your views. The code for 
a tag helper can look tortured because C# and HTML don’t mix easily. But using tag helpers 
is preferable to including blocks of C# code in a view because a tag helper can be easily 
unit tested.

Most ASP.NET Core components, such as controllers and views, are discovered automatically, but tag
helpers have to be registered. In Listing 7-29, I have added a statement to the _ViewImports.cshtml 
file in the Views folder that tells ASP.NET Core to look for tag helper classes in the SportsStore 
project. I also added an @using expression so that I can refer to the view model classes 
in views without having to qualify their names with the namespace.
