Restart ASP.NET Core and request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the new page links,
as shown in Figure 7-5. The style is still basic, which I will fix later in the chapter. 
What is important for the moment is that the links take the user from page to page 
in the catalog and allow for exploration of the products for sale. When Razor finds 
the page-model attribute on the div element, it asks the PageLinkTagHelper class 
to transform the element, which produces the set of links shown in the figure.

Improving the URLs

I have the page links working, but they still use the query string to pass page information 
to the server, like this:

http://localhost/?productPage=2

I can create URLs that are more appealing by creating a scheme that follows the pattern 
of composable URLs. A composable URL is one that makes sense to the user, like this one:

http://localhost/Page2
