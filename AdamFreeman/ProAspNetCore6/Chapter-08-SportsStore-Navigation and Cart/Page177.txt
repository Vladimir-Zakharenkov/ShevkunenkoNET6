CHAPTER 8

SportsStore: Navigation and Cart

In this chapter, I continue to build out the SportsStore example app. I add support 
for navigating around the application and start building a shopping cart.

Tip
You can download the example project for this chapter — and for all the other chapters 
in this book — from https://github.com/apress/pro-asp.net-core-6.
See Chapter 1 for how to get help if you have problems running the examples.

Adding Navigation Controls

The SportsStore application will be more useful if customers can navigate products by category. 
I will do this in three phases.

		Enhance the Index action method in the HomeController class so that it can filter
		the Product objects in the repository

		Revisit and enhance the URL scheme

		Create a category list that will go into the sidebar of the site, highlighting the
		current category and linking to others

Filtering the Product List

I am going to start by enhancing the view model class, ProductsListViewModel, which I added 
to the SportsStore project in the previous chapter. I need to communicate the current category 
to the view to render the sidebar, and this is as good a place to start as any. Listing 8-1 
shows the changes I made to the ProductsListViewModel.cs file in the Models/ViewModels folder.

Listing 8-1. Modifying the ProductsListViewModel.cs File 
in the SportsStore/Models/ViewModels Folder

namespace SportsStore.Models.ViewModels {

	public class ProductsListViewModel {
		public IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; set; } = Enumerable.Empty<Product>();
		public PagingInfo PagingInfo { get; set; } = new();
		public string? CurrentCategory { get; set; }
	}
}
