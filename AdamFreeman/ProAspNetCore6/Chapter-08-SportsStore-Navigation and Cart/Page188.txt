Figure 8-3. Using a view component

Generating Category Lists

I can now return to the navigation view component and generate a real set of categories. 
I could build the HTML for the categories programmatically, as I did for the page tag helper, 
but one of the benefits of working with view components is they can render Razor partial views. 
That means I can use the view component to generate the list of components and then use 
the more expressive Razor syntax to render the HTML that will display them. 
The first step is to update the view component, as shown in Listing 8-8.

Listing 8-8. Adding Categories in the NavigationMenuViewComponent.cs File 
in the SportsStore/Components Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using SportsStore.Models;

namespace SportsStore.Components {

	public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent {
		private IStoreRepository repository;

		public NavigationMenuViewComponent(IStoreRepository repo) {
			repository = repo;
		}

		public IViewComponentResult Invoke() {
			return View(repository.Products
				.Select(x => x.Category)
				.Distinct()
				.OrderBy(x => x));
		}
	}
}
