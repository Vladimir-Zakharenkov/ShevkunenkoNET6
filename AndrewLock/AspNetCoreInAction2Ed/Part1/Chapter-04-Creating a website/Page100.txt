Figure 4.3 Routing a request to a controller and building a binding model. A request 
to the /category/Simple URL results in the CategoryModel.OnGet page handler being 
executed, passing in a populated binding model, category.

binding model is passed to the page handler when it executes, so it can be used to
decide how to respond. For this example, the page handler uses it to decide which todo
items to display on the page.

EXECUTING A HANDLER USING THE APPLICATION MODEL

The role of the page handler as the controller in the MVC pattern is to coordinate the
generation of a response to the request it’s handling. That means it should perform
only a limited number of actions. In particular, it should

Validate that the data contained in the binding model provided is valid for the
request

Invoke the appropriate actions on the application model using services

Select an appropriate response to generate based on the response from the
application model

Figure 4.4 shows the page handler invoking an appropriate method on the application
model. Here, you can see that the application model is a somewhat abstract concept
that encapsulates the remaining non-UI parts of your application. It contains the
domain model, a number of services, and the database interaction.

DEFINITION
The domain model encapsulates complex business logic in a series
of classes that don’t depend on any infrastructure and can be easily tested.

The page handler typically calls into a single point in the application model. In our
example of viewing a to-do list category, the application model might use a variety of
