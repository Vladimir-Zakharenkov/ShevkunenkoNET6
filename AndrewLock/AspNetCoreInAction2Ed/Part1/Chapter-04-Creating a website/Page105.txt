Figure 4.7 Creating an empty ASP.NET Core template. The empty template will create 
a simple ASP.NET Core application that contains a small middleware pipeline 
without Razor Pages.

(in bold). For simplicity, also remove the existing error handler middleware
from the Configure method of Startup.cs for now:

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
	});
}

7 Right-click your project in Solution Explorer and choose Add > New Folder to
add a new folder to the root of your project. Name the new folder “Pages”.
You have now configured your project to use Razor Pages, but you don’t have
any pages yet. The following steps add a new Razor Page to your application.
You can create a similar Razor Page using the .NET CLI by running 

dotnet new page -n Index -o Pages/ 

from the project directory.

8 Right-click the new pages folder and choose Add > Razor Page, as shown in figure 4.8.

9 On the following page, select Razor Page – Empty and click Add. In the following
dialog box, name your page Index.cshtml, as shown in figure 4.9.
