PAGERESULT AND REDIRECTTOPAGERESULT

When you’re building a traditional web application with Razor Pages, usually you’ll be
using PageResult, which generates an HTML response using Razor. We’ll look at how
this happens in detail in chapter 7.

You’ll also commonly use the various redirect-based results to send the user to a
new web page. For example, when you place an order on an e-commerce website, you
typically navigate through multiple pages, as shown in figure 4.12. The web application
sends HTTP redirects whenever it needs you to move to a different page, such as
when a user submits a form. Your browser automatically follows the redirect requests,
creating a seamless flow through the checkout process.

checkout page, which validates its contents and redirects to a payment page without the user having to
manually change the URL.
