Building custom MVC and Razor Pages components

This chapter covers

• Creating custom Razor Tag Helpers
• Using view components to create complex Razor views
• Creating a custom DataAnnotations validation attribute
• Replacing the DataAnnotations validation framework with an alternative

In the previous chapter, you learned how to customize and extend some of the core
systems in ASP.NET Core: configuration, dependency injection, and your middleware
pipeline. These components form the basis of all ASP.NET Core apps. In this
chapter we’re focusing on Razor Pages and MVC/API controllers. You’ll learn how
to build custom components that work with Razor views. You’ll also learn how to
build components that work with the validation framework used by both Razor
Pages and API controllers.

We’ll start by looking at Tag Helpers. In section 20.1 I’ll show you how to create
two different Tag Helpers: one that generates HTML to describe the current
machine, and one that lets you write if statements in Razor templates without having
to use C#. These will give you the details you need to create your own custom Tag
Helpers in your own apps if the need arises.
