The Tag Helper is activated by the presence of the attribute and gets a chance to augment
the <input> tag when rendering to HTML. The Input Tag Helper uses the
name of the property to set the <input> tag’s name and id properties, the value of
the model to set the value property, and the presence of attributes such as [Required]
or [EmailAddress] to add attributes for validations:

<input type="email" id="Input_Email" name="Input.Email"
	value="test@example.com" data-val="true"
	data-val-email="The Email Address field is not a valid e-mail address."
	data-val-required="The Email Address field is required."
	/>

Tag Helpers help reduce the duplication in your code, or they can simplify common
patterns. In this section I’ll show how you can create your own custom Tag Helpers.
In section 20.1.1 you’ll create a system information Tag Helper, which prints
details about the name and operating system of the server your app is running on.

In section 20.1.2 you’ll create a Tag Helper that you can use to conditionally show or
hide an element based on a C# Boolean property. In section 20.1.3 you’ll create a
Tag Helper that reads the Razor content written inside the Tag Helper and transforms
it.

20.1.1 Printing environment information with a custom Tag Helper

A common problem you may run into when you start running your web applications
in production, especially if you’re using a server-farm setup, is working out which
machine rendered the page you’re currently looking at. Similarly, when deploying frequently,
it can be useful to know which version of the application is running. When I’m
developing and testing, I sometimes like to add a little “info dump” at the bottom of
my layouts so I can easily work out which server generated the current page, which
environment it’s running in, and so on.

In this section, I’m going to show you how to build a custom Tag Helper to output
system information to your layout. You’ll be able to toggle the information it displays,
but by default it will display the machine name and operating system on which the
app is running, as shown in figure 20.1.

You can call this Tag Helper from Razor by creating a <system-info> element in
your template:

<footer>
	<system-info></system-info>
</footer>
