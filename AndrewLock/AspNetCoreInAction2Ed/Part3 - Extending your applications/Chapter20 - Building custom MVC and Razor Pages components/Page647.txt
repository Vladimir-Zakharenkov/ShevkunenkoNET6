You also call SuppressOutput(), which prevents any content inside the attributed element
from being rendered. If RenderContent is true, you skip these steps and the
content is rendered as normal.

One other point of note is the overridden Order property. This controls the order
in which Tag Helpers run when multiple Tag Helpers are applied to an element. By
setting Order to int.MinValue, you ensure that IfTagHelper will run first, removing
the element if required, before other Tag Helpers execute. There痴 generally no
point running other Tag Helpers if the element is going to be removed from the
page anyway.

NOTE
Remember to register your custom Tag Helpers in _ViewImports.cshtml
with the @addTagHelper directive.

With a simple HTML attribute, you can now conditionally render elements in Razor
templates without having to fall back to C#. This Tag Helper can show and hide content
without needing to know what the content is. In the next section we値l create a
Tag Helper that does need to know the content.

20.1.3 Creating a Tag Helper to convert Markdown to HTML

The two Tag Helpers shown so far are agnostic to the content written inside the Tag
Helper, but it can also be useful to create Tag Helpers that inspect, retrieve, and modify
this content. In this section you値l see an example of one such Tag Helper that converts
Markdown content written inside it into HTML.(1)

DEFINITION
Markdown is a commonly used text-based markup language that
is easy to read but can also be converted into HTML. It is the common format
used by README files on GitHub, and I use it to write blog posts, for example.
For an introduction to Markdown, see the GitHub guide: 
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.

We値l use the popular Markdig library (https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) to create
the Markdown Tag Helper. This library converts a string containing Markdown into
an HTML string. You can install Markdig using Visual Studio by running 

dotnet add package Markdig

or by adding a <PackageReference> to your .csproj file:

<PackageReference Include="Markdig" Version="0.22.0" />

The Markdown Tag Helper that we値l create shortly can be used by adding <markdown>
elements to your Razor Page, as shown in the following listing.

(1)	The open source library WebAPIContrib.Core includes a similar tag helper, 
	as well as other helpful utilities. You can find it on NuGet and GitHub at
