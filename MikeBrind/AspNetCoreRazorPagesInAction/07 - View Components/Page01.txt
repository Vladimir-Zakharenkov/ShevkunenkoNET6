View Components in Razor Pages

View Components perform a similar role to Tag Helpers and Partial Pages. 
They generate HTML and are designed to represent reusable snippets of UI 
that can help break up and simplify complex layouts, or that can be used 
in multiple pages. View components are recommended instead of partial pages 
or tag helpers whenever any form of logic is required to obtain data for inclusion 
in the resulting HTML snippet, specifically calls to an external resource such as a file, 
database or web service. View components also lend themselves to unit testing.

View components are particularly useful for data-driven features in a layout page 
where there is no related page model or controller class. Examples of use cases for 
view components include data-driven menus, tag clouds and shopping basket widgets.
