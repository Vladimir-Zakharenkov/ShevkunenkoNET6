Uploading Files in Razor Pages

For the most part, you will use forms to capture data from the user as simple string, 
numeric, datetime or boolean values. Forms can also be used to upload files. 
Successful file uploading has three basic requirements:

1. The form must use the post method

2. The form must have an enctype attribute set to multipart/form-data

3. The uploaded file must map to an IFormFile data type

Upload and save to folder

The following code features a very simple page called UploadFile.cshtml 
with a form for uploading a file:

@page
@model UploadFileModel
@{
}
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" asp-for="Upload" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>

The form has the correct enctype and the action is post, satisfying the first 
two requirements. The third requirement is satisfied in the page model class 
for the page:

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace RazorPagesForms.Pages
{
    public class UploadFileModel : PageModel
    {
        private IHostingEnvironment _environment;
        public UploadFileModel(IHostingEnvironment environment)
        {
            _environment = environment;
        }
        [BindProperty]
        public IFormFile Upload { get; set; }
        public async Task OnPostAsync()
        {
            var file = Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, "uploads", Upload.FileName);
            using (var fileStream = new FileStream(file, FileMode.Create))
            {
                await Upload.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
            }
        }
    }
}

An IFormFile is added as a public property to the to the page model. It is decorated with 
the BindProperty attribute, to ensure that it participates in model binding. The property 
is given the same name as the name attribute on the file input in the form - "Upload" 
which ensures that model binding will copy the contents of the upload to the public property.
